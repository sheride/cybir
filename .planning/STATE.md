# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-11)

**Core value:** A clean, well-documented, modular implementation of GV-based EKC construction that is easy to use, extend, and understand
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — core-mathematics

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (core-mathematics) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-12

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Foundation-first approach -- data types and test infrastructure before porting math (prior refactors failed without this)
- [Roadmap]: 3-phase coarse structure: Foundation -> Core Math -> Pipeline & Integration
- [Phase 01]: Used __setattr__ + _frozen flag for immutability (not frozen dataclass) to support numpy arrays
- [Phase 01]: PhaseGraph uses string labels as node keys; ExtremalContraction start/end store labels not objects
- [Phase 02]: projected_int_nums uses explicit einsum subscripts per n_projected value to avoid index collision

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Weyl orbit expansion (PIPE-02) has known quality issues in the original code -- may need careful review during Phase 3
- ENH-02 (tuned complex structure mode) deferred to v2 -- user wants to discuss during implementation, not now
